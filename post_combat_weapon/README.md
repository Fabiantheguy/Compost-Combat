  Weapons used in post-combat games created by John Wang,  and three types of firearms, Energy Weapon,  Melee Weapon, and Ranged Weapon, are designed so far, which can add more. Energy Weapon can be created for high-powered combat scenarios, utilizing energy-based projectiles, which can only be triggered when charged and have a function to avoid being overcharged. A Melee Weapon is to provide close-range combat mechanics that emphasize physical interaction between players and enemies. Unlike ranged or energy weapons, melee weapons require proximity to the enemy, making fights more intense and strategic. A ranged weapon with a charge mechanic is designed to balance precision and power, allowing the player to build up energy before firing for a more potent shot. Unlike traditional ranged weapons that fire instantly, charge-based weapons reward patience and strategic timing. The design patterns are used to enhance the creation of guns and behavior control, such as Factory Patterns used for dynamic weapon creation, strategy patterns used to define unique attack behaviors for different weapons, command patterns used to execute weapon actions dynamically, and observer patterns used to notify UI when weapon state changes. A simple score and reward system is built to let players play for a longer time, which needs to be enhanced as well.
